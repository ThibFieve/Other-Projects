Tasks: The goal was to design and assess the feasibility of a radio network on a Covered region of a 100 km x 100 km square area centered around the city of Redmond, Oregon, USA.

Result: Using Radio Link and Network Link tool we were able to take into account the topology and therefore the shadowing effects , from that we managed to design the system so that the network coverage would be  corresponding to the requirement. Finally we mapped the network coverage.

Tasks: The goal was to recover useful data from noisy radar images taken by a plane as well as a satellite over the topology of the ground. 

Result: In order to correctly retrieve the data from the plane  we used Time Domain Back Projection (TDBP) and data focusing.
To extract data from the satellite, we used interferometry between two of its scan, with this we were able to detect changes onto the ground and its topology. From that we could conclude that the area was the intersection of two tectonic plates
.

Tasks: The goal was to implement a synchronous counter on LT Spice and to implement it on a test board.

Result: To do so I implemented a T Flip Flop , And gates and Xor Gates. After successful implementation on LT spice , it was tried out on test boards.
